This code is meant to replace and augment existing
code in the Weather Research Forecasting with Chemsitry
(WRF-CHEM) atmospheric model such that it will allow the
model to capture the effects of volcanic aggregation.

The bulk of the changes are to modult_vash_settling.F.

Fortran files need to be placed in the chem subdirectory 
and registry.chem in the Registry directory. The 
volc_d01.asc files need to be placed in the em_real
directory with properly formatted eruption information. 

The name list files are examples to help the user format
their namelists for WRF and WPS.
